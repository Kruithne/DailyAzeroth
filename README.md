== DailyAzeroth ==

DailyAzeroth is a simply in-game interface that allows players to easily manage their common repetitive tasks over multiple characters from one simple and easy to use tool. The addon provides a simple tool-set for players to keep on top of their daily/weekly chores!

To get started in-game, simply type in "/dailyazeroth" or "/da" for short.

This originally started out as a Windows application however after popular request I've ported it to an in-game version. There are still some features yet to be added, so stay tuned!
